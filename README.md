## Hi there 👋 I'm Juan, a Full Stack Developer Jr. 👨‍💻

After several years of working in the hotel industry, my desire for new challenges and my passion for technology encouraged me to pursue a career in coding. It was at this moment when I decided to take the "Plataforma 5 Coding Bootcamp", where during 3 intense months of 10 hours of constant daily coding, I was able to learn from the basics to the last top technologies used in today's IT Industry. 💻

At the moment, I am looking for my first job as a Developer, so here you can find my latest projects where I have worked and develop. 🕶️
