## Hi there üëã I'm Juan, a Full Stack Developer üë®‚Äçüíª

After several years of working in the hotel industry, my desire for new challenges and my passion for technology encouraged me to pursue a career in coding. It was at this moment when I decided to take the "Plataforma 5 Coding Bootcamp", where during 3 intense months of 10 hours of constant daily coding, I was able to learn from the basics to the last top technologies used in today's IT Industry. üíª
